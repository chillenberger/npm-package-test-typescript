# Shared Components

### This repository will house UI components hosted on AWS CodeArtifact to be used across apps

## Create AWS Resources

AWS resources are made using [AWS Serverless Application Model CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/).

template.yaml was created from [library-reference-data](https://github.com/Smart-Warehousing/library-reference-data/tree/swat-281-testing#library-reference-data) POC. It creates resource domain and repository. If the desired domain and repository is already created, you do not need to redeploy.

## Connect to AWS CodeArtifact repository

First the user must be logged into the correct aws sso profile. Do this by running `aws sso login --profile <desired environment>`.

Then connect to the npm registry with `npm run co:login`.

Verify the desired registry is being used by running the command `npm -d ping`.
you should see `npm notice PING https://YOUR DOMAIN - ACCOUNT NUMBER.d.codeartifact. YOUR REGION .amazonaws.com/npm/YOUR REPOSITORY /`

To change back to the default npm registry use `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.com/`

## Commit

This repository uses commitizen for structuring commit messages.

## Build Dist File

The dist file is the project build output. To perform a new build run the command `npm build`.
This will clean the dist folder and rebuild the library.

## Publishing

As of now, to publish the developer must increment the version in package.json then use npm publish. This will publish the contents of the dist folder, package.json, and readme.md.

## Development

Since this is a component library, and not a deployable webapp, we cannot use react start to see our work as we develope. Instead we use [Storybook ](https://storybook.js.org/) to view components.

To view the component components, in your folder, create a `<YOUR COMPONENT>.story.tsx` file. Use another story as a template to create your story. Once completed run the command `npm run storybook`. Your component will be visible at the localhost:6006.


## NPM 

When connected to Code Artifact only select npm command are supported.  See [Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/npm-commands.html)
